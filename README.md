# Apis and Microservices Projects - File Metadata Microservice

This project is part of FreeCodeCamp. Below are the user stories:

- I can submit a form object that includes a file upload
- The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing
- When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON responsefree to try it out and see what metadata comes back!

This app is built by using express, node.js, html5, css
